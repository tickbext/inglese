## PART ONE: THE VICTORIAN AGE

### 1. Queen Victoria and Her Reign
Queen Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837 and reigned until her death in 1901. Her rule lasted over six decades, making it one of the longest reigns in British history. Under her, Britain underwent profound political, social, and economic changes:
- **Political stability**: Despite social unrest, her reign symbolized continuity and stability.
- **Industrial growth**: Rapid industrialization transformed Britain into the “workshop of the world.”
- **Moral values**: The term “Victorian” came to represent strict moral standards, respectability, and a strong sense of duty.

### 2. Main Acts Between 1833 and 1875
A series of legislative reforms aimed at improving working conditions and expanding political rights took place during the early and mid-Victorian period. Some of the most significant acts and movements include:
- **1833 – The First Factory Act**: Limited working hours for children in textile mills and required some basic education for child workers.
- **1838 – The People’s Charter**: Launched by the Chartist Movement, it demanded universal male suffrage, the secret ballot, and payment for Members of Parliament, among other reforms.
- **1846 – Free Trade (Repeal of the Corn Laws)**: Initiated by Sir Robert Peel, it removed tariffs on imported grain, symbolizing Britain’s commitment to free trade and encouraging cheaper bread for the populace.
- **Formation of Parties**: During this period, the old Tory and Whig factions evolved more distinctly into the Conservative and Liberal parties, shaping modern British politics.

### 3. A Period of Technological Advancements
The first part of the Victorian Age was characterized by:
- **Innovations**: The spread of the railway network, the steam engine, and the telegraph revolutionized transport and communication.
- **Optimism**: Many Victorians believed in progress—science and technology promised a better future.
- **Wealth vs. Poverty**: While industrialization created immense wealth for factory owners and entrepreneurs, it also led to overcrowded slums and poor working conditions for laborers. This stark contrast fueled social reform movements.

### 4. Why Was It Called the Age of Empire?
Queen Victoria also became known as the “Empress of India,” and Britain’s imperial reach extended across the globe. The empire expanded or was consolidated in:
- **China**: The Opium Wars (1839–1842, 1856–1860) forced China to open ports to British trade.
- **The Crimean War (1853–1856)**: Britain allied with France and the Ottoman Empire against Russia, showcasing Britain’s influence on continental affairs.
- **Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand**: Colonies received various degrees of self-government but remained under the British Crown.
- **Africa**: Britain acquired large territories, often justified by a “civilizing mission.”
- **India**: After the Indian Mutiny (1857), administration of India shifted from the East India Company directly to the British Crown.
- **The Boer War (1899–1902)** in South Africa further highlighted British imperial ambition, though it was costly and controversial.

### 5. The Great Exhibition
Held in 1851 in London’s Crystal Palace, the Great Exhibition was a massive showcase of industrial achievements:
- **Function**: It displayed Britain’s manufacturing supremacy and the latest inventions from around the world.
- **Symbol of Optimism**: Visitors saw it as proof of human progress and the triumph of British industry, reinforcing national pride.

### 6. The End of Optimism
Despite the early optimism, the late Victorian period witnessed:
- **Trade Depression and Social Questions**: Economic slumps and growing awareness of poverty challenged the belief in unending progress.
- **Imperial Criticisms**: Conflicts such as the Boer War were controversial and costly, shaking the confidence of many in the moral righteousness of empire.
- **Shifts in Values**: Scientific discoveries (e.g., Darwin’s theory of evolution) and social changes led to questioning traditional religious and moral certainties.

## PART TWO: OSCAR WILDE AND AESTHETICISM

### 1. Brief Overview of Oscar Wilde’s Life
Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) was born in Dublin and studied at Trinity College (Dublin) and later at Oxford. Known for his wit, flamboyant style, and brilliant conversational skills, he became a leading figure in the Aesthetic Movement. His works include:
- **Plays**: *Lady Windermere’s Fan*, *An Ideal Husband*, *The Importance of Being Earnest*
- **Novel**: *The Picture of Dorian Gray* (1890, revised 1891)
- **Essays and Lectures**: On art, beauty, and society

Wilde’s downfall came after a high-profile trial for “gross indecency,” leading to imprisonment. He spent his final years in exile in France, dying in poverty in 1900.

### 2. Who Was a Dandy?
From Wilde’s perspective—and in Victorian society at large—a **dandy** was:
- A man devoted to elegance, style, and wit.
- Someone who saw life itself as a form of art, focusing on personal appearance, manners, and cultivated speech.
- A figure who often stood in contrast to bourgeois morality, rejecting conventional middle-class values in favor of beauty and self-expression.

### 3. The Cult of Beauty in the Past vs. the Present
- **Past**: Beauty was often associated with moral or religious significance. Art frequently served religious, didactic, or moral functions.
- **Victorian Aesthetic Movement**: “Art for Art’s Sake” (“l’art pour l’art”)—Art was valued purely for its beauty, separate from moral or instructional aims.
- **Present**: We might see echoes of Wilde’s aesthetic ideals in consumer culture, fashion, and social media, where self-presentation and visual appeal remain influential. However, the modern emphasis on instant sharing and commercialism differs from the Victorian quest for an elevated, artistic life.

### 4. What Was “Arriviamo” and Its Motto?
The term “arriviamo” does not appear as a standard reference in Wilde’s English texts, but if we treat it as part of the general aesthetic or “arrival” at the idea of **Art for Art’s Sake**, we might say:
- It represents the *momentum* and enthusiasm of aesthetic artists proclaiming the supremacy of beauty.
- The **motto** closely aligned with the Aesthetic Movement is often cited as “Art for Art’s Sake,” celebrating the creation and appreciation of beauty without moral or utilitarian constraints.

### 5. The Plot of *The Picture of Dorian Gray*
- **Main Characters**:
  - **Dorian Gray**: A handsome, impressionable young man.
  - **Basil Hallward**: An artist who becomes infatuated with Dorian’s beauty and paints his portrait.
  - **Lord Henry Wotton**: A witty, cynical aristocrat who influences Dorian with his hedonistic worldview.
- **Summary**:
  1. Basil paints a portrait capturing Dorian’s youthful beauty.
  2. Influenced by Lord Henry, Dorian wishes that the painting would age instead of him, allowing him to remain forever young.
  3. Over time, Dorian leads a life of moral corruption and indulgence. His external appearance remains youthful, but the portrait becomes hideous, reflecting his inner sins.
  4. Dorian’s guilt and fear grow. He ultimately destroys the painting in a desperate attempt to free himself, resulting in his own death. When discovered, Dorian’s body is aged and disfigured, while the portrait is once again beautiful.

### 6. Narrative Technique
Wilde uses a **third-person narrative** interspersed with extensive dialogue and philosophical asides:
- **Why?** This method allows characters—especially Lord Henry—to expound on aesthetic theories and social critiques. It also creates a certain detachment, letting the reader judge Dorian’s moral descent.

### 7. Why Does the Novel Represent the Victorian Compromise?
Victorian society often presented a **respectable exterior** (emphasizing morality and duty) while concealing scandals and moral transgressions beneath the surface:
- **Outward Respectability**: Dorian appears respectable and eternally youthful.
- **Hidden Corruption**: The portrait symbolizes the secret sins and corruption that polite society was loath to acknowledge.  
Thus, the novel reflects the tension between public virtue and private vice—an embodiment of the “Victorian compromise.”

### 8. Dangers of a Superficial Society and the Moral of the Novel
- **Superficiality**: Wilde critiques the obsession with external beauty, social status, and pleasure at the expense of moral responsibility.
- **Consequences**: Dorian’s pursuit of endless pleasure, spurred by Lord Henry’s philosophy, leads to moral and spiritual decay.
- **Moral**: The ultimate message warns that neglecting one’s conscience for aesthetic or hedonistic gratification results in destruction—physical, moral, and spiritual.

### 9. An Example of Wilde’s Aphorism
Wilde was famous for his short, witty sayings. One example is:
> “I can resist everything except temptation.”

**Definition**: An aphorism is a concise statement that expresses a general truth or insight, often in a witty or paradoxical manner.  
**Discussion**: Wilde’s aphorisms usually subvert conventional wisdom, highlighting the contradictions of society or human nature with humor and style.

### 10. Does Dorian (and Wilde) Want to Confess? Does He Feel Guilty?
- **Dorian’s Inner Conflict**: Throughout the novel, Dorian oscillates between fear and guilt. He contemplates confessing or reforming but is also terrified of losing his youth and facing society’s judgment.
- **Guilt**: The portrait becomes a constant reminder of his sins, suggesting he does have a conscience. However, his vanity and fear of consequences prevent a true, open confession until his final act of desperation—destroying the painting.
- **Wilde’s Perspective**: Wilde often explored the idea that society punishes those who break its rules, even while being fascinated by them. Dorian’s struggle implies that the weight of guilt is inescapable, yet open confession is thwarted by vanity and social pressures.

### Concluding Note
The Victorian Age was a period of remarkable progress and expansion, yet it also revealed deep social and moral contradictions—precisely the issues that Oscar Wilde dramatized in his life and work. His novel *The Picture of Dorian Gray* remains a vivid critique of superficial values and a testament to the tension between appearance and reality, making it emblematic of the Victorian compromise and the perils of living purely for beauty and pleasure.
