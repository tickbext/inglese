## PART TWO: OSCAR WILDE AND AESTHETICISM

### 1. Brief Overview of Oscar Wilde’s Life
Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) was an Irish writer known for his wit and style. His works include plays like *The Importance of Being Earnest* and the novel *The Picture of Dorian Gray*. He was a leading figure in the Aesthetic Movement, which valued beauty and art. Wilde’s life ended in scandal, and he died in poverty in 1900.

### 2. Who Was a Dandy?
A **dandy** was:
- A man focused on elegance, style, and wit.
- Someone who saw life as art, valuing appearance and manners.
- A figure who often rejected middle-class values in favor of beauty and self-expression.

### 3. The Cult of Beauty in the Past vs. the Present
- **Past**: Beauty was linked to moral or religious meaning.
- **Victorian Aesthetic Movement**: Art was valued for its beauty alone, not for moral lessons.
- **Present**: Modern culture values appearance and self-presentation, but often for commercial reasons, unlike the Victorian focus on art.

### 4. What Was “Arriviamo” and Its Motto?
“Arriviamo” isn’t a standard term in Wilde’s work, but it can be linked to the idea of **Art for Art’s Sake**:
- It represents the enthusiasm for beauty and art.
- The **motto** “Art for Art’s Sake” celebrates beauty without moral or practical purposes.

### 5. The Plot of *The Picture of Dorian Gray*
- **Main Characters**:
  - **Dorian Gray**: A young man who stays young while his portrait ages.
  - **Basil Hallward**: The artist who paints Dorian’s portrait.
  - **Lord Henry Wotton**: A cynical aristocrat who influences Dorian.
- **Summary**:
  1. Basil paints Dorian’s portrait.
  2. Dorian wishes to stay young, and the portrait ages instead.
  3. Dorian lives a life of sin, and the portrait shows his corruption.
  4. Dorian destroys the portrait, leading to his death.

### 6. Narrative Technique
Wilde uses a **third-person narrative** with lots of dialogue:
- **Why?** This allows characters to discuss ideas and lets readers judge Dorian’s actions.

### 7. Why Does the Novel Represent the Victorian Compromise?
Victorian society valued outward respectability but hid scandals:
- **Outward Respectability**: Dorian appears young and respectable.
- **Hidden Corruption**: The portrait shows his sins, reflecting the tension between public virtue and private vice.

### 8. Dangers of a Superficial Society and the Moral of the Novel
- **Superficiality**: Wilde criticizes the focus on appearance and pleasure over morals.
- **Consequences**: Dorian’s pursuit of pleasure leads to his downfall.
- **Moral**: Neglecting conscience for beauty or pleasure leads to destruction.

### 9. An Example of Wilde’s Aphorism
Wilde was known for his witty sayings, like:
> “I can resist everything except temptation.”

**Definition**: An aphorism is a short, clever statement that expresses a truth.
**Discussion**: Wilde’s aphorisms often challenge conventional ideas with humor.

### 10. Does Dorian (and Wilde) Want to Confess? Does He Feel Guilty?
- **Dorian’s Inner Conflict**: Dorian feels guilt but fears losing his youth and facing judgment.
- **Guilt**: The portrait reminds him of his sins, but he avoids confession until the end.
- **Wilde’s Perspective**: Wilde suggests that society punishes rule-breakers, even as it is fascinated by them.

### Concluding Note
The Victorian Age was a time of progress and contradictions, which Oscar Wilde explored in his life and work. *The Picture of Dorian Gray* critiques superficial values and the tension between appearance and reality, reflecting the Victorian compromise and the dangers of living for beauty and pleasure alone.
